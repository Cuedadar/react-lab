# Module Lab: React

This project demonstrates my understanding of react component composition, fetching data from an API, and event handlers.

**A live version of the site can be found at [Netlify](https://jtking-trivia.netlify.app/)**

This website is built on React and uses basic CSS styling to run a small, one-question trivia game with questions and categories
pulled from the **[Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/)** 

Project source and assets are in the "src" and "src\assets" folders respectively.

I would love to extend this to a fully featured web app and mobile at some time. This was great fun to make
and extending this would be very simple. Throwing our own backend API in front of OTDB would make
putting this across multiple front end clients simple.
